The Marina Restaurant in Brattleboro, Vermont 
reopened in July 2011 after a July 2010 fire . <br><br><br>

Everyone’s destination ~ The Marina Restaurant in Brattleboro
sits on the water and offers great views all year round. 
Amazing sunsets are a specialty!<br><br>

Seafood, burgers and steaks, pasta, kid’s menu, homemade desserts are the best! 
We serve Lunch and Dinner seven days a week along with the always popular Sunday Brunch Buffet, accompanied by Live Jazz guitar with Draa Hobbs.<br><br>

The new restaurant design keeps everything that regulars know and love - the deck, the menu, and the staff - and has added new features for better cooking and serving, comfort, and efficiency.<br><br>

A beautiful view of the water is enjoyed from almost every seat in the restaurant.  Amazing sunsets can be appreciated from the fabulous first floor and mezzanine dining spots or from an outdoor, dockside seating area. The bar and lounge area has been greatly expanded and is a popular destination every day of the week.<br><br>

Located where the Connecticut and West Rivers meet on Route 5 in Brattleboro, Vermont, The Marina is a memorable, casual dining experience for everyone.<br><br>
