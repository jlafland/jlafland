                       <p>I welcome you to the world of energy healing and the power of your energy field, the basic structure of your life, to create wellness and joy. “Your energy flows where the mind goes,” and your energy field is the channel that links your mind’s intention with your physical wellbeing. You’ll learn to adopt higher thoughts and attitudes that produce a calm mind and renewed health and an openness to receiving more from life. Spin Straw to Gold workshops are the true integration of a mind/body/spirit practice and return to wholeness.   </p>

                        <li>Channel the power of your thoughts, release toxic beliefs and blockages that hinder the  healing process</li>
                        <li>Weave together and harmonize your mind and heart and sense the recharging and vitality  now present in your energy field.  </li>
                        <li>Become self-empowered - develop a practice that sustains growth and positive spiritual attitudes.        </li>
                        <li>Create self-confidence as you find a clearer, more centered and aware presence.</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>Energy medicine blends the mechanics of science with the power of thought and spiritual intention.  It embraces the simple fundamentals of positive belief along with practices that shift the body into a more receptive mode for healing and meaningful change that reach beyond traditional medicine to create healing from the core. </p>

                      <p>Ten years ago I was devastated after failing to heal after my treatment for breast cancer. Consumed with fear, depression, and despair I continued in a downward spiral; my attitude self-perpetuating my own illness. Determined to reclaim my life I learned to redirect my thoughts and attitudes to soften and calm my energy field, attract my desire from the universal field, and create a healing environment for my body and mind. Today, having experienced the transformation from hopelessness to renewal, I am testimony to its success.</p>

                      <p>From my darkest days the search for this deeper source of wellness became my passion and now passing this knowledge to others has become my calling and my own avenue to continued learning and growth. My hope is that my experience will inspire others to spread the word that we can be our own practitioner, that our wellness is easily within our own grasp. A different attitude is only a pivot away. </p>

                    Ask Linda about her passion for wellness and she will glow. Her decade-long journey started as a cancer patient disabled by fear and depression and blossomed into her life’s mission to help others nurture wellness and become their best selves.
                    <br><br>
                    Linda’s failure to heal after treatment for breast cancer fueled her search to find the source of core wellness; that force that seeks to rise to the surface in all of us. After studying several alternative health modalities and wellness philosophies she found accelerated healing and joy in the new field of Energy Medicine, the integration of science and spirituality and the accompanying power of thought.
                    <br><br>
                    Studies led to energy medicine pioneer Donna Eden at the Omega Institute, the Barbara Brennan Hands of Light program, and the American Society of Dowsers. Continuing education added Law of Attraction, Field of the Heart, and quantum mechanics. Coaches honed her clairvoyant skills and inspiring mentors collaborated and motivated.
                    <br><br>
                    Spin Straw to Gold, the second chapter in Linda’s life, was created as the vehicle to pass this knowledge to others who are also seeking to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Linda sees and feels energy fields and adds her personal flair by dowsing participant’s fields. Workshops include cancer retreats, aids projects, substance abuse programs, and motivational and women’s groups.
                    <br><br>
                    In her first chapter Linda worked for a counseling program, spent the bulk of her career as the director of a regional Chamber of Commerce and later as the director of a small college campus. Her B.S. is from Lyndon State College and she is a graduate of Leadership Vermont, the US Chamber of Commerce Institute for Nonprofit Management and Leadership Development and the American Society of Trainers and Developers Train the Trainer program.
                    <br><br>
                    Linda is a fifth-generation Vermont native and divides her time between Vermont and Southern California.
